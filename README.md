# CWH-UCLA-Project
School Greening & Watershed Equity Project
Project Overview
The Council for Watershed Health (CWH) serves as a Watershed Coordinator for the Safe, Clean Water Program (SCWP). This project addresses the challenge of fragmented environmental and demographic data by creating a Unified School Layer for all K-12 public schools in LA County.

By joining disparate datasets into a single database, this tool identifies "Intersectional Opportunity Sites" campuses with a high need for environmental cooling (canopy) and stormwater management (permeability) that also serve disadvantaged communities.

Key Objectives

Centralize Data: Integrate scores from CalEnviroScreen, the California Schoolyard Tree Canopy Equity Study, and SCWP planning tools into a single actionable layer.


Prioritize Equity: Identify high-need schools based on pollution burden and socioeconomic factors.


Analyze Connectivity: Map the physical relationship between schools, local parks, and protected bike lanes.


Stormwater Potential: Rank campuses where "low canopy + high pollution + high infiltration potential" intersect to maximize stormwater capture.

Software & Package Requirements
To run the analysis scripts in this repository, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

Data Analysis: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib


Statistical Modeling: scikit-learn (for Random Forest scoring algorithms)
